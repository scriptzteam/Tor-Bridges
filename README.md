# Tor-Bridges-Collector

Collecting Tor Bridges.

Why?
```
This is to show how broken Tor bridges distributions are.
Please fix your system!
P.S.: We are against oppressive regimes!
```

That's great! Then please stop helping the oppressive regimes and talk with the Tor Project about how this can be fixed. Just going "is broken, plz fix" doesn't really help, especially not when it is know that these systems aren't perfect.

Types of pluggable transport:
```
Obfs4 bridges makes Tor traffic look random, and also prevents censors from finding bridges by Internet scanning.

Snowflake bridges are improvement upon Flashproxy. It sends your traffic through WebRTC, a peer-to-peer protocol with built-in NAT punching. 

Vanilla bridges are unobfuscated bridges.
```
